# Configuration Files

This folder contains copies of all configuration files for easy reference and organization.

## ⚠️ Important Note

**Essential config files must remain at the project root** for tools to work properly:
- `package.json` - Required by npm/node (always at root)
- `next.config.js` - Required by Next.js (must be at root)
- `tsconfig.json` - Required by TypeScript (must be at root)
- `vercel.json` - Required by Vercel (must be at root)
- `eslint.config.js` - Required by Next.js ESLint (must be at root)
- `postcss.config.js` - Required by Next.js/Tailwind (must be at root)
- `components.json` - Required by shadcn/ui CLI (must be at root)
- `next-env.d.ts` - Auto-generated by Next.js (must be at root)

## 📁 Files in This Folder

1. **prettier.config.js** - Prettier formatting config (can be moved, referenced in package.json)
2. **eslint.config.js** - ESLint configuration (copy - original must be at root)
3. **postcss.config.js** - PostCSS configuration (copy - original must be at root)
4. **components.json** - shadcn/ui component configuration (copy - original must be at root)
5. **next.config.js** - Next.js configuration (copy - original must be at root)
6. **tsconfig.json** - TypeScript configuration (copy - original must be at root)
7. **vercel.json** - Vercel deployment configuration (copy - original must be at root)

## 🔄 Making Changes

When updating configuration:
1. **Edit the root file** (the one tools actually use)
2. **Copy to this folder** for reference: `cp <filename> config/`
3. Or edit both if you want to keep them in sync

## 📝 Why This Structure?

Many build tools and frameworks expect configuration files at the project root. This folder serves as:
- **Documentation** - See all configs in one place
- **Backup** - Reference copies if needed
- **Organization** - Cleaner root directory view

The actual working configs remain at root where tools expect them.
